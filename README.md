# foodmate-chatbot
The chatbot offers a grocery list where users can manage items and get reminders for similar products. It also provides recipe search based on keywords or the list, and offers nutritional analysis for recipes, food items, or listed products.

The chatbot would provide the following services:
1. Grocery list service: Users can add/remove/modify products in a grocery list. The products could then be categorized via an external API. This way, the user could be reminded, when reading a product in the list, of the need for other similar nature products, saving them from returning to that section of the supermarket.
2. Recipe search service: Users input a list of keywords (ingredients), or starting from the grocery list, and receive as output an arbitrary number of possible recipes to prepare.
3. Nutritional analysis service: Users ask the chatbot for the nutritional information of a recipe, a food item, or a specific product present within the grocery list.
